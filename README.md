# FastAPI JWT Authentication Microservice

This FastAPI-based microservice provides JWT-based authentication for user registration, login, token verification, and refresh. The application uses two SQLite databases: one for the application endpoints and another for running tests.
Features

    ## JWT Authentication: Secure authentication with access and refresh tokens.
    Endpoints:
        /register: Register a new user.
        /login: Obtain access tokens.
        /token/refresh: Refresh an existing token.
        /token/verify: Verify the validity of a token.
        /logout: Log out the user.

## Requirements

To run this project locally, you need to have the following installed:

    Docker
    Docker Compose

## How to Run the Application


### 1. Clone the Repository

bash

    git clone https://github.com/aisaacbg/fastapi-jwt-auth.git

### 2. Build and Run the Docker Container

To build and run the application inside a Docker container, use:

bash

    docker-compose up --build

The application will be available at http://0.0.0.0:8000/.
### 3. Access the API Documentation

You can view the auto-generated API documentation by FastAPI at:

    Swagger UI: http://0.0.0.0:8000/docs
    ReDoc: http://0.0.0.0:8000/redoc

These endpoints provide interactive API documentation where you can test the different endpoints.
### 4. Running Tests

This project uses a separate SQLite database for testing, isolated from the main database used by the application endpoints.

To run the tests, execute the following command:

bash

    docker-compose exec app pytest


This will run the test suite inside the Docker container and display the results.

Alternatively, if you prefer to run the tests without entering the container:

bash

    docker-compose run app pytest

### 5. Environment Variables

The application relies on environment variables to configure certain parameters. These are defined in the .env file. Here are the important variables:

    SECRET_KEY: The key used for JWT encoding/decoding.
    ALGORITHM: The algorithm used for encoding the JWT (e.g., HS256).
    ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES: Token expiration time in minutes.
    DATABASE_URL: The URL for the main SQLite database (e.g., sqlite:///./app.db).
    TEST_DATABASE_URL: The URL for the test SQLite database (e.g., sqlite:///./test.db).

Setting Up the .env File

Make sure to set up your .env file correctly before running the project. Here is an example of what your .env file might look like:

makefile

SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
ALGORITHM=HS256
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./app.db
